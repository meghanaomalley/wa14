<h1 style="color: black"> Presenting Information</h1>
<p>During the semester we have used a bunch of differnt ways to present information.We have used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, RevealJS, Vega, and Jupyter notebooks. Though there are differnt methods of showing information we use them in differnt ways.  </p>

<p> HTML and CSS is a powerful way to present information. This would be used on a website such as a portfollio. If I were to write a blog about the TV show then I would most likly present the information in this form. This is good for writing information and adding simple heierarchies of information.</p>

<p>Continuing, we had also worked with Bootstrap. I enjoyed bootstrap because it can elevate your work by making it more aestectically pleasing. I would use this if the TV information was a more professional sense. </p>

<p>Lastly, we also worked with ReavealJS, Vega, and Jupyter Notebooks. RevealJS is perfect if I wanted to present my TV assignment in a powerpoint form. What is cool about Reaveal JS is how the presentation is a link and how the slide can have a down arrow. Vega and Jupter Notebooks are good tools for more data science vibes. These come in handy to incorporate graphs and other key codeing type things.</p>

<p> We had covered many areas in the course. But there are still other mediums as well such as social media. These can be used to reach a large crowd. But, there are pros and cons for each method.</p>
